    <h2> <em>Enhancements </em> </h2>
    <p> Added a 3rd page, created unique drink names and descriptions, added color to each drink for more personality, added more style to the main page and to the other pages like italics, bolding and color. </p>

    <h2> What I Learned / Want to Learn</h2>
    <p> The main thing I learned from this assignment was how to link to my own webpages and how to add a lot more styling to them like background color and borders. I would like to learn how to make a next page button that allows the user to move from one page to the next without a link.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned / Want to Learn Ch 4:</h2>
    <p>For chapter 4 I've learned how to add an ID to your headers so that they can be linked to specifically. I've also learned how to pull up the source code for any website, also I've learned how to make it so that links make a separate window. For what I want to learn I think learning more style options to make the website look better would be cool.</p>
