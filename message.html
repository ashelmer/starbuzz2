    <h1> Owner's Message</h1>
    <p> Operations have been running very smoothly at the coffee shop these last few weeks. Tom has done a great job as your new manager. Due to your newfound success every employee of Andrew's Coffee Shop will be invited to a company wide pizza party on the 1st of September. (Only 1 slice per person and if you want to be paid for your time you'll be required to use your own PTO).</p>
